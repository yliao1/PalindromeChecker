1. Use "./PalindromeCheckerServer.exe -port=1200" to run the program. (Run this first before you run clients!)
2. You can run multiple clients to test the server that can handle more than one clients.
3. You can send an empty string from clients to tell the server that the clients are about to be closed.
4. When all clients are closed, the active users of server will be 0. Then, the server will be closed automatically.

Use a terminal to run the program, don't just double click!
If you are using Ubuntu, don't add '.exe' at the end of the program.

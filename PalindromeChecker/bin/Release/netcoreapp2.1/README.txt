1. Use "./PalindromeChecker.exe -ip=127.0.0.1 -port=1200" to run the program. (Run the server first!)
2. You can run multiple instances to test the server that can handle more than one clients.
3. You can send an empty string to tell server the client is about to be closed.
4. When all instances are closed, the active users in server will be 0. Then, the server will be closed automatically.

Use a terminal to run the program, don't just double click!
